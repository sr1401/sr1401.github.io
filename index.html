                            a breed of cat usually characterized by ears that fold forward and down. 
                            The first Scottish Fold was a barn cat discovered in 1961. 
                            For show, Scottish Folds are required to have the turned-down ears—but these are a result of a genetic mutation, 
                            so not all purebred Scottish Folds have them.</p>

                            are perhaps the quintessential "luxury" cat—that is, the cat who expects to be kept in the lap of luxury. 
                            They are, however, the most popular cat breed in the world. Although they are known for the pushed-in 
                            "Pekingese" nose that many are bred for, arguably the best part of these cats is their pettability. 
                            All that fur needs a lot of daily grooming, however, and Persians are prone to kidney disease, 
                            so they need frequent ultrasounds.</p>

                        <p class="description">The British Shorthair is known for both its looks and its typically easygoing and 
                            fun-loving personality. The appealing chunkiness of its face and body and its plush, 
                            thick fur match its sturdy temperament. The wide-cheeked faces of British Shorthairs appear to be smiling 
                            and more expressive than many cat breeds’, and it’s said that they were the inspiration for the wide-grinning 
                            Cheshire Cat of Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. British Shorthairs are reputed to be 
                            doglike in their readiness for fun and games, such as fetching.</p>
